  option and "retain_pos" RC file field.
- Undo for Search and replace is now a single operation rather than having to 
  manually undo each string replaced.
- When saving a file ~/ is now expanded into the home directory path if it is
  at the beginning of the filename. Also ~<username> is expanded into the given
  users home directory path.
- The "subchar" field in the RC file will now accept the word "space" allowing
  you to set a space (ascii 32) as the substitution char for non printing
  characters. You can also use "space" with the -s option but its somewhat
  redundant as " " works just as well on the command line.
- Reduced redraws when entering text in the command pane.
- Delete key now works in command pane text entry (eg filename, searches).
- Swapped action of 'A' and 'S' commands.
- Fixed assert crash when deleting the last character in the file when its
