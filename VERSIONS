20231206
========
- Undo will now undo search and replace text as well as single characters.


20231213
========
- Changed insert into an insert mode (toggle via F3) that means you can now
  insert directly by typing instead of reserving space first.
- Undo list now unlimited (except by memory) length
- Undo will now undo inserts and deletes.
- Header info updates including addition of file size and mode.
- Removed some unnecessary screen redraws.


20231219
========
- Added RC file functionality. See README for more info.


20231227
========
- Hexed can now start without a file being given with -f. In this instance it
  allocates a single byte in memory and sets it to zero.
- Reduced amount of unnecessary redraws.
- More efficient memory allocation.


20240109
========
- Added lowercase hex functionality via -l command line option and 'L' command.
- Added retain pre undo cursor position functionality via -u command line
  option and "retain_pos" RC file field.
- Undo for Search and replace is now a single operation rather than having to 
  manually undo each string replaced.
- When saving a file ~/ is now expanded into the home directory path if it is
  at the beginning of the filename. Also ~<username> is expanded into the given
  users home directory path.
- The "subchar" field in the RC file will now accept the word "space" allowing
  you to set a space (ascii 32) as the substitution char for non printing
  characters. You can also use "space" with the -s option but its somewhat
  redundant as " " works just as well on the command line.
- Reduced redraws when entering text in the command pane.
- Delete key now works in command pane text entry (eg filename, searches).
- Swapped action of 'A' and 'S' commands.
- Fixed assert crash when deleting the last character in the file when its 
  displayed at the start of the text/hex pane.
- Fixed old 'A' (now 'S') command crash when filename not set.
- Fixed off by one file size in "File position" field.
- Fixed F8 key not working in Linux console.
- Fixed green colour bug when pressing 'C' while help or decode displaying.
- Minor look and feel updates and mods.


20240123
========
- Search and replace strings can now differ in length.
- Removed update count message as it wasn't much use except for search and
  replace - the count for which is already given at the top - and just 
  complicated the code.
- Fixed S&R input sanity checker bug whereby it would say 2 strings were the
  same if they we different lengths but the replacement string was a subset.
- Fixed undo location position colouring bug following insert/delete locations.


20240130
========
- Added case insensitive text search and replace via new 'W' command.
- Minor command panel updates.


20240205
========
- Changed the slightly confusing "system" and "reverse" to "big" and "little" 
  endian in the data decode page (depending on which one the system is).
- Minor bug fix in same page.
