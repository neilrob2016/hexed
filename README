Hexed
-----
This is a colour command line hex editor for MacOS and Linux. To compile
just type "make" then "hexed -f <filename>" to edit a file. Type 'H' to
get a list of commands and function keys.

Note - this uses ANSI terminal codes directly instead of curses for coding 
efficiency. The curses API is hideously long winded and given almost all
virtual terminals now support ANSI there's little point in using curses.
IMO YMMV.
