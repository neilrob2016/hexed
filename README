Intro
=====
This is a colour command line hex editor for MacOS and Linux. To compile
just type "make" then "hexed -f <filename>" to edit a file. Type 'H' to
get a list of commands and function keys.

Note - this uses ANSI terminal codes directly instead of curses for coding 
efficiency. The curses API is hideously long winded and given almost all
virtual terminals now support ANSI there's little point in using curses.
IMO YMMV.

RC file
=======
As of version 20231219 I added a run command (RC) file option -r. This contains
settings equivalent to the command line options. If no RC file is given hexed
will attempt to read ~/.hexedrc but if its not there it carries on.

Option    Valid values           Cmd line
------    ------------           --------
cursor    blk,udl,bar            -c
mode      insert,overwrite       -i
colour    on,off                 -n 
pane      hex,text,cmd           -p
subchar   <single char>          -s
termsize  <width>x<height>       -x

An example RC file is with the source called example_rc.
